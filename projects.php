    <h1>MY PROJECTS</h1>

    <h2>WEB DESIGN PROJECTS</h2>
    <br>
<P>In form five I did several web design lessons and did two projects where I  was supposed to create a simple website
    where I was to use CSS and HTML before introducing Javascript in it. 
</P>
<p>Currently am working on my portfolio website where it ain't easy either.</p>
