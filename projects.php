    <h1>MY PROJECTS</h1>
    <br>
    <P>In my years in my highschool at Starehe Boys' Centre I did several projects including a Presidential Award project where I visited an orphanage togethr with my fellow students and did alot there. We played with the kids, helped them in their studies and also helped them at their chores.</P>
<br>
    <h2>WEB DESIGN PROJECTS</h2>
    <br>
<P>In form five I did several web design lessons and did two projects where I  was supposed to create a simple website
    where I was to use CSS and HTML before introducing Javascript in it. 
</P>
<p>Currently am working on my portfolio website where it ain't easy either.</p>
